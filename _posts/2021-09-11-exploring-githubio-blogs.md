Well, it has been several years since I did anything interesting with my blog!! And now, I'm considering building out a portfolio site that also functions as a blog.

For years, I have been on [Wordpress.com](https://aiexplorations.in), and a couple of years ago, I bought the domain [aiexplorations.in](https://aiexplorations.in) to host my blog.

Mostly, Wordpress has treated me well, and I have had not much reason to complain given my use cases. However, exploring Github Pages made me consider it.

Wordpress' restrictive fonts and styles and the block based editing are probably preventing me from utilizing the full capabilities of that platform.

Themes cost money on Wordpress, and the process of writing posts from the comfort of one's text editor is compelling. I also hope to use the effort I put into maintaining this website as a learning experience to learn about the broader spectrum of web technologies and the workflows therein. Although I first fiddled around with HTML and CSS around 2004 for my first blog, I haven't actually had a whole lot of effort put into web development per se, neither the Github-native workflows which make it a cinch these days.

Of late, I have been writing a book and a lot of my attention has been directed there, apart from figuring out the interesting projects and opportunities that are coming my way at this stage of my career. I hope that this website will also become a channel for me to discuss my book and ideas around it, and create a space for discussion around it.

I think that the speed of ideas has increased greatly in AI, machine learning and data science. I seem to be living two sets of lives here, one where there's a lot of technical and code-level stuff at work, and one where there is a higher level of messaging being sent out on social media and blogs.

Perhaps the best way to unify these worlds is to have blogs hosted on Github.io. This is my reason to consider this platform. 

I hope to gain some steam as I become comfortable doing this kind of thing routinely, and perhaps this will compel me to post some of the experiments with code, data and algorithms that I routinely write each week.

See you in the near future!
