# Exploring Github.io blogs

Well, it has been several years since I did anything interesting with my blog!!

For years, I have been on Wordpress.com, and a couple of years ago, I bought the domain aiexplorations.in to host my blog.

Mostly Wordpress has treated me well, and I have had not much reason to complain given my use cases. However, exploring Github.io blogs made me consider otherwise.

Wordpress' restrictive fonts and styles and the block based editing are probably preventing me from utilizing the full capabilities of that platform.

Themes cost money there, and the process of writing posts from the comfort of one's text editor is compelling.

Of late, I have been writing a book and a lot of my attention has been directed there, apart from figuring out the interesting projects and opportunities that are coming my way at this stage of my career.

I think that the speed of ideas has increased greatly in AI, machine learning and data science. I seem to be living two sets of lives here, one where there's a lot of technical and code-level stuff at work, and one where there is a higher level of messaging being sent out on social media and blogs.

Perhaps the best way to unify these worlds is to have blogs hosted on Github.io. This is my reason to consider this platform. 

I hope to gain some steam as I become comfortable doing this kind of thing routinely, and perhaps this will compel me to post some of the experiments with code, data and algorithms that I routinely write each week.

See you in the near future!
